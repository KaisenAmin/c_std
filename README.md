## Compilation and Execution


### CMake Support

This project now supports building with CMake, a powerful cross-platform build system that simplifies the process of compiling and linking code.

### Building with CMake

To build the project using CMake, follow these steps:

1. **Install CMake**:
   - Ensure that CMake is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official website](https://cmake.org/download/) or use a package manager like `apt`, `brew`, or `choco` depending on your operating system.

2. **Create a Build Directory**:
   - Navigate to the root directory of the project and create a build directory:

     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     ```

3. **Generate Build Files**:
   - Run CMake to generate the build files for your system:

     ```bash
     cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
     ```

4. **Compile the Project**:
   - Once the build files are generated, compile the project using `make` (or another build tool depending on your system):

     ```bash
     make
     ```

5. **Run the Compiled Program**:
   - After compilation, the executable and shared libraries will be located in the `build` directory. You can run the executable directly:

     ```bash
     ./main
     ```

   - On Linux, ensure to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` if you're using shared libraries:

     ```bash
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ./build/main
     ```

### Adding Modules with CMake

If you add new modules, you need to update the `CMakeLists.txt` file to include them. This file is used by CMake to configure the build process. Here's how to add a new module:

1. **Edit `CMakeLists.txt`**:
   - Add the new module's source files to the `add_library` or `add_executable` commands in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

2. **Re-run CMake**:
   - After editing `CMakeLists.txt`, re-run CMake in the `build` directory:

     ```bash
     cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
     ```

3. **Compile Again**:
   - Use `make` or another build tool to compile the updated project.


This project utilizes a Python script (`compile.py`) for easy compilation of modules, making the build process straightforward and efficient.

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- GCC compiler (ensure it's added to your system's PATH)
- **Linux Users**: Make sure to install the necessary development libraries:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt install build-essential git cmake libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev wayland-protocols libwayland-dev pkg-config libxinerama-dev libxkbcommon-dev
  sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libpq-dev libraylib-dev
  ```

### Using the compile.py Script

To compile the entire project, simply run the `compile.py` script with the `b` argument:

```bash
python compile.py b
```

This command compiles all source files and produces an executable in the `./build` directory.

### Running the Compiled Program

To compile and immediately run the compiled program, use the `r` argument:

```bash
python compile.py r
```

On Linux, make sure to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before running the program:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./build/main
```

### Compiling to Shared Libraries Only

To compile only the shared libraries (DLLs or `.so` files) for each module, use the `l` argument:

```bash
python compile.py l
```

This command compiles all source files into shared libraries in the `./build` directory without producing an executable.

### Adding New Modules

If you add new modules or directories containing `.c` files, simply include their paths in the `source_directories` list within the `compile.py` script. The script automatically finds and compiles all `.c` files in the specified directories.

### Streamlined Build Process

The use of `compile.py` eliminates the need for traditional makefiles or manual compilation commands, providing a simple and unified build process. The script handles dependencies, includes, and linking, ensuring a hassle-free compilation experience.

## Manual Compilation Using GCC

For developers who prefer manual compilation or need to integrate the project into other build systems, the source files can be compiled using the GCC command line. While the `compile.py` script is recommended for its convenience and automated handling of file dependencies, manual compilation offers flexibility for advanced use cases.

### Requirements for Manual Compilation
- GCC compiler (ensure it's added to your system's PATH)
- C17 standard support in GCC

### Compiling with GCC

To manually compile a specific module or your entire project, you can use the GCC command with the `-std=c17` flag to ensure compliance with the C17 standard. Here's an example command to compile a program with the `vector` module:

```bash
gcc -std=c17 -O3 -march=native -flto -funroll-loops -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -s -o your_program your_program.c vector.c
```

In this command:
- `-std=c17` specifies the use of the C17 standard.
- `-O3`, `-march=native`, `-flto`, and `-funroll-loops` are optimization flags.
- `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-pedantic` enable additional warnings for better code quality.
- `-s` strips the binary for a smaller executable size.
- `your_program.c` is your main C source file.
- `vector.c` is the source file for the `vector` module (include other `.c` files as needed).
- `your_program` is the output executable file.

### Customizing the Compilation

You can modify the GCC command to suit your specific requirements, such as including additional modules, linking libraries, or adjusting optimization levels. This approach offers full

 control over the compilation process, allowing you to tailor it to your project's needs.
